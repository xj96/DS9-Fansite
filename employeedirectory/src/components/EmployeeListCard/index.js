Sisko entered Starfleet Academy in 2350. During his sophomore year, he was in a field-study assignment on Starbase 137. He met a woman named Jennifer in Babylon, New York, on Gilgo Beach, shortly after graduating from the Academy. The two eventually wed and had a son named Jake. In 2369, Sisko is assigned to the Bajoran sector to command Deep Space Nine and to help Bajor's recovery from the recently concluded Cardassian occupation, shepherding them toward possible membership in the Federation.",

As such, Jadzia has access to all the skills and memories of the symbiont's seven previous hosts.

In 2357, Worf entered Starfleet Academy. He graduated in 2361 and was commissioned with the rank of Ensign, becoming the first Klingon officer in Starfleet. Although Worf took immense pride and a sense of honor from serving in Starfleet, most other Klingons shunned and belittled his choice of vocation.",

He came to the station while it was named Terok Nor during the Cardassian occupation of Bajor. Originally, Quark admired the Cardassian race for their version of morality, but later he seemed to take pity on the downtrodden Bajoran people, selling them food and equipment just above cost, which could have gotten him into serious trouble if the Cardassians had found out. When the station changed hands at the end of the occupation, he decided to leave. Commander Sisko, feeling that Quark's Bar (which offered holosuites and gambling) would encourage commercial tourism to boost the station's economy, extorted Quark into staying, using Quark's nephew Nog as a bargaining chip.",

He had a knack for fixing things but, until around 2372, he worked exclusively as a waiter and stock boy in his brother Quark's bar. After four years living among Federation and Bajoran citizens on the station, and possibly inspired by his son Nog's admission to Starfleet (which made him very proud), Rom left the bar to become an engineer in the Bajoran Militia.",

After going through the Ferengi coming-of-age rite, he requests an apprenticeship under Commander, later Captain, Benjamin Sisko in order to attend Starfleet Academy.
